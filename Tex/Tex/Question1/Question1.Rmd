# Introduction \label{Introduction}

Purpose of this work folder, is to provide an outline as to how I approached the questions in this exam.

All data sets are saved in the data folder of the root of the folder. Binary files will be in bin, and closed R functions in code. Human Readable settings files (e.g. csv) will be placed in settings.

All questions are saved in their own folder within the root file. Thank you, lets begin this journey!

# Data  {-}

About covid. 

First load in the data using read.csv. 

```{r}
covid_dat <- read.csv("data/Covid/owid-covid-data.csv", header = TRUE)
Death_by_cause <- read.csv("data/Covid/Deaths_by_cause.csv", header = TRUE)
covid_desc <- read.csv("data/Covid/covid_data_description.csv", header = TRUE)
```


Notice how I used the curly brackets and dash to remove the numbering of the data section.

Discussion of data should be thorough with a table of statistics and ideally a figure.

In your tempalte folder, you will find a Data and a Code folder. In order to keep your data files neat, store all of them in your Data folder. Also, I strongly suggest keeping this Rmd file for writing and executing commands, not writing out long pieces of data-wrangling. In the example below, I simply create a ggplot template for scatter plot consistency. I suggest keeping all your data in a data folder.

<!-- The following is a code chunk. It must have its own unique name (after the r), or no name. After the comma follows commands for R which are self-explanatory. By default, the code and messages will not be printed in your pdf, just the output: -->

```{r Figure1,  warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.

  g <-
  ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = hp, color = cyl)) +
  theme_bw() +
  # theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.x = element_text()) +
  labs(y = "y-axis", x = "x-axis", title = "Some amazing plot")

g

```

To make your graphs look extra nice in latex world, you could use Tikz device. Replace dev - 'png' with 'tikz' in the chunk below. Notice this makes the build time longer and produces extra tex files - so if you are comfortable with this, set your device to Tikz and try it out:

```{r Figure2, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure2}", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, dev = 'png'}

ExampleData <- read_rds( "data/Example_data.rds")

source("code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R") # Load a function from your 'code' folder. This e.g. plots scatters to your own preferences.
source( "code/Data_Create.R") #

ExampleData <- Data_Create(N = 100) # Same as the ExampleData loaded above - this is just a function to create the stored data.

g <- Example_Plot_Scatter(DataInput = ExampleData,
                          X = "Height_Score",
                          Y = "Weight_Score",
                          Z = "Agility_Score",
                          Theme = theme_bw(), # run ?ggthemes for other themes.
                          Title = "", # I prefer to use the caption set above.
                          Ylab = "Height",
                          Xlab = "Lenght",
                          LegendTitle = "Agility",
                          TitleSize = 10,
                          LabSize = 10)

g

# Although the functions above are really simple, the principle is simple: containing calculations and data wrangling in their own functions will make this template much cleaner and more manageable.
# When you start working, delete these meaningless functions and replace with your own...

```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, Figures \ref{Figure1}  and \ref{Figure2} are excellent, with Figure \ref{Figure2} being particularly aesthetically pleasing due to its device setting of Tikz. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

# Splitting a page

You can also very easily split a page using built-in Pandoc formatting. I comment this out in the code (as this has caused issues building the pdf for some users - which I presume to be a Pandoc issue), but you are welcome to try it out yourself by commenting out the following section in your Rmd file.


<!-- :::::: {.columns data-latex="[T]"} -->
<!-- ::: {.column data-latex="{0.7\textwidth}"} -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(cars, pch = 19) -->

#  Methodology \label{Meth}

## Subsection
Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]

## Math section

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align}
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \label{eq1} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1 \notag
\end{align}

If you would like to see the equations as you type in Rmarkdown, use $ symbols instead (see this for yourself by adjusted the equation):

$$
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \\
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1
$$

Note the equation above - this should appear in math in Rstudio. Writing nice math requires practice. Note I used a forward slashes to make a space in the equations. I can also align equations using  __\&__, and set to numbering only the first line. Now I will have to type ``begin equation'' which is a native \LaTeX command. Here follows a more complicated equation that you want aligned (using \& sign) and numbered:


\begin{align}
	y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag
	e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
		D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
		\sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
		R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
		Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

Note that in \ref{eq2} I have aligned the equations by the equal signs. I also want only one tag, and I create spaces using ``quads''.

See if you can figure out how to do complex math using the two examples provided in \ref{eq1} and \ref{eq2}.

# Results

Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ (or kable) package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page (there are, however, very many ways to skin this cat. Luckily there are many forums online!).


```{r ShortTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)
data <- mtcars[1:5,] %>% tibble::as_tibble()

table <- xtable(data, caption = "Short Table Example \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table,
             # tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H',
             # scalebox = 0.3,
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )

```

To reference calculations __in text__, _do this:_ From table \ref{tab1} we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`.

Including tables that span across pages, use the following (note that I add below the table: ``continue on the next page''). This is a neat way of splitting your table across a page.

Use the following default settings to build your own possibly long tables. Note that the following will fit on one page if it can, but cleanly spreads over multiple pages:

```{r LongTable, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)

data = mtcars %>% tibble::as_tibble()
  addtorow          <- list()
  addtorow$pos      <- list()
  addtorow$pos[[1]] <- c(0)
  addtorow$command  <- c(paste("\\hline \n",
                               "\\endhead \n",
                               "\\hline \n",
                               "{\\footnotesize Continued on next page} \n",
                               "\\endfoot \n",
                               "\\endlastfoot \n",sep=""))
table <- xtable(data, caption = "Long Table Example")
  print.xtable(table,
             tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = FALSE, # Leave this as is.
             table.placement = 'H', # Leave this as is.
             booktabs = T, # Aesthetics
             include.rownames = FALSE,  # Typically you don't want this in a table.
             add.to.row = addtorow, # For adding the Continued on next page part...
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'top',  # Where do you want the caption?
             size="\\fontsize{12pt}{13pt}\\selectfont"  # Size of text in table..
             )
# See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf for table inspiration
```

<!-- hfill can be used to create a space, like here between text and table. -->


## Huxtable

Huxtable is a very nice package for making working with tables between Rmarkdown and Tex easier.

This cost some adjustment to the Tex templates to make it work, but it now works nicely.

See documentation for this package [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html). A particularly nice addition of this package is for making the printing of regression results a joy (see [here](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/huxtable.html#creating-a-regression-table)). Here follows an example:


If you are eager to use huxtable, comment out the Huxtable table in the Rmd template, and uncomment the colortbl package in your Rmd's root.

We wrangle the data a bit to have less columns and more rows and easier to work with. 

```{r}

covid_dat <- tibble::tibble(covid_dat) %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date))

covid_plot <-  covid_dat %>% 
    group_by(`location`) %>% select(date, location, continent, total_cases, total_deaths, total_tests, total_vaccinations) %>% #gather (Healthstat, Number, -`date`, -`location`, -`continent`, na.rm =T) %>% mutate(Healthstat = gsub("Explained by: ", "", Healthstat)) %>% 
    arrange(date)


g <- covid_plot %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_line(aes(x = date, y = total_deaths, color = continent), alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~continent, scales = "free_y") +       ggthemes::scale_color_wsj() + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(x = "", 
    y = "Prices", title = "Heath Stats for different continents", subtitle = "Total Deaths across Continents", 
    caption = "Data source: COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University & National Government Reports", x = "", y = "The number of people")

g

g + 
geom_line(data = covid_plot, aes(x = date, y = total_cases, color = continent), alpha = 0.5, size = 1) + 
    geom_label(data = covid_plot, aes(date,total_cases, label = continent), size = 3, alpha = 0.1) + geom_label(data = covid_plot, 
    aes(date, total_deaths, label = continent), size = 3, alpha = 0.1)
    
    
    

h <- covid_plot %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_line(aes(x = date, y = total_cases, color = continent), alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~continent, scales = "free_y") +       ggthemes::scale_color_economist() + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(x = "", 
    y = "Prices", title = "Heath Stats for different continents", subtitle = "Total Cases across Continents", 
    caption = "Data source: COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University & National Government Reports", x = "", y = "The number of people")

h

j <- 
    covid_plot %>% 
ggplot() + 
geom_line(aes(x = date, y = total_vaccinations, color = continent), alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~continent, scales = "free_y") +       ggthemes::scale_color_economist() + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + labs(x = "", 
    y = "Prices", title = "Heath Stats for different continents", subtitle = "Total Vaccinations across Continents", 
    caption = "Data source: COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University & National Government Reports", x = "", y = "The number of people")

j 

```

For the concentrated groups we focus here on poverty and the elderly, and try to see if these increased the same time covid hit, or are they not correlated at all? 

```{r}

covid_intens <-  covid_dat %>%
  select(continent, total_deaths, extreme_poverty, aged_65_older) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  mutate(avg_pov = mean(extreme_poverty),
            pov_diff = extreme_poverty - avg_pov,
            cats = ifelse(avg_pov >= median(avg_pov), "high", ifelse(avg_pov <= median(avg_pop),"critical", "severe"))) %>% 
   ungroup() 

table_intense <- xtable(covid_intens, caption = "Table of specific Concentrated groups")
    

```

Now we check for the increased hospitilisation, using hospital patients per million and used ICU patients:  

```{r}

covid_plot2 <- covid_dat %>%  select(date, location, continent, hosp_patients, icu_patients) %>% group_by(continent) %>% mutate(hosp_patients_avg = mean(hosp_patients)) %>% mutate(icu_avg = mean(icu_patients)) %>%  mutate(hosp_inc = hosp_patients /lag(hosp_patients) - 1) %>% mutate(icu_lag = icu_patients /lag(icu_patients) - 1) %>% gather(Type, Number, -date, -location, - continent, -hosp_patients_avg, -icu_avg) %>%  ungroup()

hosp_plot <- 
    covid_plot2 %>% 
    ggplot() +
    geom_bar(aes(x = date, y = Number, fill = Type), stat = "identity") +
    facet_wrap(~Type, scales = "free_y", nrow = 2) +
    scale_x_date(labels = scales::date_format("%b '%y")) +
    theme_bw() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
    labs(x = "", y = "") + guides(fill = F)

```


```{r}

rmsfuns::build_path(paste0(getwd(), "Figures"))

ggsave(filename = "Figures/Plot.png", plot = covid_plot_bar, width = 6, height = 6, 
    device = "png")

```

```{r}
Texevier::create_template(directory = "C:/Users/mishq/OneDrive/Documents/Ro-eagan/Data Science for Econometrics S1/DatsciPractical23/20784538/Question1/Tex/Tex",
                          template_name = "Question1",
                          build_project = T, open_project = T)


```
